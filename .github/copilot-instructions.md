# AI Assistant Instructions

## CRITICAL: Source Control Protocol

- ALWAYS create a new changeset BEFORE making any changes:

   ```bash
   jj new -m "copilot: description of changes"
   ```

- ALWAYS verify the current changeset with:

   ```bash
   jj log -n 3 --no-pager
   jj show --no-pager
   ```
- After completing changes, ALWAYS update the changeset with my prompt and your response:

   ```bash
   jj desc -m '''copilot: description of changes
   
   jgaines: I want a cool script.

   copilot: Here is a cool script that does X, Y, and Z.

   âœ… Script Created Successfully
   The really_cool.sh script:

   Takes a location parameter (work or play) as required, etc.
   '''
   ```

- NEVER change files outside of this repository unless explicitly instructed.   

## Documentation Rules

- ALL documentation must be in Markdown format
- NEVER use notebook format
- README.md must describe repository purpose and use
- Use meaningful, descriptive file names. Examples: install_mise.sh, install_brew.sh, backup_brew.sh

## Scripting Requirements

- Scripts MUST be simple bash scripts
- Include only minimal error checking
- Use "#!/usr/bin/env bash" shebang.
- Use simple linear logic, small regex matches, and basic string manipulation
- Limit user choices to y/n only
- Scripts should include 'cd $(dirname $0) || exit 1' after setting flags to ensure they run in the correct directory

## File Organization

- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Follow existing naming patterns
- Group related files logically
