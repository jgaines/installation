# Documentation Rule

All documentation in this project must follow these standards:

1. All documentation must be in Markdown format.
2. Never use notebook format for any documents.
3. The top-level README.md must describe the repository's purpose and use.
4. Use meaningful, descriptive file names for documentation (e.g., install_mise.sh, install_brew.sh, backup_brew.sh).
