# Jujutsu (jj) Source Control Rule

This rule describes the required workflow and best practices for using Jujutsu (jj) as source control in this project.

## Workflow

1. **Always create a new changeset before making any changes:**
   ```bash
   jj new -m "short description of your changes"
   ```
   - Do this before editing any files.  
   - If you make changes before creating a new changeset, those changes will be added to the parent changeset, which is usually not what you want.

2. **Viewing changesets and history:**
   - To view the commit log:
     ```bash
     jj log --no-pager
     ```
   - The current changeset is marked with `@`.
   - Uncommitted changesets are marked with `○`.
   - Pushed changesets are marked with `◆`.

3. **Describing and managing changesets:**
   - To view the current changeset:
     ```bash
     jj show --no-pager
     ```
   - To add or change the description of a changeset:
     ```bash
     jj desc -m "new description" [changesetID]
     ```
     - Omit `[changesetID]` to modify the current changeset.

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Never edit files before creating a new changeset.
   - Keep changeset descriptions short and meaningful.
   - Only push changesets that are ready for sharing.

## Example

```bash
jj new -m "update documentation"
# make your changes
jj show --no-pager
```
