## Description

The final output of the backup_vscode_settings.sh script is unclear when either of the backup folders is not found.  The current output is:

```shell
‚ùØ ./backup_vscode_settings.sh home
Starting VS Code settings backup for location: home
Working copy  (@) now at: vtmtwtlt 2a86edee (empty) back up home vscode settings
Parent commit (@-)      : pxztvtys ea4528ff (empty) (no description set)
Backing up VS Code settings to: ./vscode_settings/home
  Copying: User/globalStorage/alefragnani.project-manager/projects.json
  Copying: User/keybindings.json
  Copying: User/settings.json
Warning: VS Code Insiders config directory not found: /home/jgaines/.config/Code - Insiders
Backup completed successfully!
Files backed up to:
  VS Code: ./vscode_settings/home
  VS Code Insiders: ./vscode_settings/ihome
```

The final block shouldn't indicate that it backed up ./vscode_settings/ihome, if in fact it did not.  Instead it should look more like this:

```text
Files backed up to:
  VS Code: ./vscode_settings/home
  VS Code Insiders: not found
```

## Implementation Notes

Modified backup_files function to return proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure). Updated main script logic to capture return codes and track success status for both VS Code and VS Code Insiders. Replaced hardcoded final output with conditional output that shows actual backup paths for successful backups and 'not found' for missing directories. The script now provides accurate feedback about what was actually backed up.
