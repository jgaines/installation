## Description

Remove the standalone install_railpack.sh script since railpack installation is now handled by mise. This eliminates redundancy and simplifies the installation setup.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] install_railpack.sh file is deleted from the repository
- [ ] Verify no other scripts or documentation reference the removed script
- [ ] Confirm railpack functionality is available through mise

## Implementation Plan

1. Search repository for any references to install_railpack.sh
2. Verify that railpack is available through mise
3. Delete install_railpack.sh file
4. Test that railpack functionality still works via mise
5. Confirm no broken references remain
