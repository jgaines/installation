## Description

Create a script to backup mise configuration and tool lists. This ensures that all installed mise tools can be restored on a new system. The backup should copy the mise.toml file from ~/allmise and provide commands to reinstall tools. This is critical for development environment restoration since mise manages many essential development tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script copies mise.toml from ~/allmise to backup location
- [ ] Backup includes location parameter support (work/home) like other scripts
- [ ] Script handles cases where mise or ~/allmise directory is not found
- [ ] Backup generates restoration commands for easy tool reinstallation
- [ ] Backup location is organized consistently with other backup scripts

## Implementation Plan

1. Create backup_mise.sh script following existing script patterns
2. Check if mise command and ~/allmise directory exist
3. Copy mise.toml from ~/allmise to backup location (e.g., ./mise_settings/)
4. Generate restoration commands using the grep/sed command from README
5. Add location parameter support (work/home) for organization
6. Include success/failure feedback and error handling
7. Test with and without mise installed
8. Consider backing up additional mise files if they exist
9. Document restoration process in backup location
