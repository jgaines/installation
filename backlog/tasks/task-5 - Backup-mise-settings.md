## Description

Create a script to backup mise configuration and tool lists. This ensures that all installed mise tools can be restored on a new system. The backup should copy the mise.toml file from ~/allmise and provide commands to reinstall tools. This is critical for development environment restoration since mise manages many essential development tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script copies mise.toml from ~/allmise to backup location
- [ ] Backup includes location parameter support (work/home) like other scripts
- [ ] Script handles cases where mise or ~/allmise directory is not found
- [ ] Backup generates restoration commands for easy tool reinstallation
- [ ] Backup location is organized consistently with other backup scripts

## Implementation Plan

1. Create backup_mise.sh script following existing script patterns
2. Check if mise command and ~/allmise directory exist
3. Copy mise.toml from ~/allmise to backup location (e.g., ./mise_settings/)
4. Generate restoration commands using the grep/sed command from README
5. Add location parameter support (work/home) for organization
6. Include success/failure feedback and error handling
7. Test with and without mise installed
8. Consider backing up additional mise files if they exist
9. Document restoration process in backup location

## Implementation Notes

Successfully created backup_mise.sh script following existing backup patterns. The script copies mise.toml from ~/allmise to backup directories, includes location parameter support (work/home), and handles missing mise installations gracefully. Generated comprehensive restoration commands including both bulk restore (mise install) and individual tool commands (59 tools backed up). The script provides clear documentation for restoration process and integrates well with existing backup workflows.
