## Description

Create a script to install distrobox using the official installation method. Distrobox allows running different Linux distributions in containers with tight integration to the host system. The script should download and install distrobox to ~/.local prefix for user-local installation without requiring root privileges.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script downloads distrobox installer from official GitHub repository
- [ ] Installation uses --prefix ~/.local for user-local installation
- [ ] Script includes proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Script follows existing installation script patterns in the repository
- [ ] Installation method matches the provided curl command exactly

## Implementation Plan

1. Create install_distrobox.sh script following existing installation script patterns
2. Add standard bash script headers and error handling (set -euo pipefail)
3. Include user confirmation before installation like other install scripts
4. Use the exact curl command: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sh -s -- --prefix ~/.local
5. Add proper error checking and user feedback messages
6. Test the script to ensure it works correctly
7. Make the script executable
8. Document what distrobox provides in script comments

## Resolution

Closed out because it turns out it installs just fine in brew without an excessive number of dependencies and being in brew it'll be easier to keep it updated.
